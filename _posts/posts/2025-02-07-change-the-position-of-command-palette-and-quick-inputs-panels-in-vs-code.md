title: Change the position of Command Palette and Quick Inputs panels in VS Code
category: posts
---

VS Code released the [January 2025 (v1.97)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_97) release yesterday, and it’s again packed with a lot of good stuff. One small but welcome change is that [the position](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_97/#_move-the-command-palette-and-quick-inputs) of the Command Palette and Quick Inputs panels can be customized! Who doesn’t love customization, right?

Until now these panels always opened at the top. You can reposition them now. There are a few options:

- Top
- Center
- Custom position

You can set the position via the “Customize Layout” picker in the top bar, or you can open one of the panels and start dragging it around. The new position will persist accross reloads.
