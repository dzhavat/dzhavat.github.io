title: Fully expand PR status checks on GitHub
category: posts
---

One thing I absolutely love about working on the Web is that I can literally tweak any web page according to my preferences.

You know, I can build a browser extension that changes colors, font sizes, improves accessibility, moves boxes, removes things I don’t need, etc. I can also write my own [bookmarklet](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/) for doing the same.

This is what I did recently after patiently enduring what I consider to be an annoying limitation on the PR (Pull Request) status checks list on GitHub.

PR status checks is a list of checks that show the status of all pipeline runs related to a PR. They are usually the last section on the PR page right before the “merge” button and the comment section.

What annoys me about this list is that it can’t be fully expanded. There’s a toggle to either hide all checks or show them but the list has a set height that limits how many items can be shown at a time. And sometimes the list can be quite long. If a run fails, it becomes quite annoying to scroll up and down to find what has failed.

So I built my own bookmarklet that simply removes the height and thus the list expands fully. Needless to say, I use it all time now 😎

Here’s a video 👇

In case you want to use it too, here’s the source code:

```js
javascript: (() => {
  document.querySelector(
    '.merge-status-list.js-updatable-content-preserve-scroll-position'
  ).style.maxHeight = 'none';
})();
```

Happy coding 😉
