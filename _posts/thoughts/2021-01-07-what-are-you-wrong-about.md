There's a thought in my head that has been constantly coming back over the last few weeks and I know it will not go away unil I share it. And what better place for that than my blog?

We all have opinions about things, that being programming languages, best practices, food, cars, religion or life in general. And we are sometimes stubborn about some of our opinions no matter what arguments someone might present to us. We refuse to change them.

But here's the thing. One can't be right 100% of the time! That's not possible. That's not human. And that is what's bothering me. So if that is the case, then it means that I hold some opinions right now which are wrong but I still don't want to accept it.
